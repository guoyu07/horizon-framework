Here it is! A boilerplate theme for the Horizon Framework.

**What is Horizon?**
--------------------

Horizon is a WordPress framework that allows for rapid theme development. Born out of the necessity to build websites quickly, Horizon allows you to make your own extremely customisable themes using the built-in page builder, theme options and shortcodes!

**Quick Start**
---------------

1. Import the SAMPLE_DATA.xml file using WordPress Import plugin (tools -> import -> WordPress)
2. Dry-save the admin panel (load it up and hit save)
3. Set the left and right menus respectively in the menu page

**Wiki**
--------

I'm building a wiki! Check it out [here](https://github.com/joemckie/horizon-framework/wiki)!

**Features**
------------

Horizon is an extremely powerful framework to run WordPress websites on. Here are a few of its features:

* **Awesome customisable admin panel.** - Add a new option by simply adding a new array!

* **Real time typography previews.** - Edit font size, colour, decoration, transform, and choose from over 300 Google Fonts, and see the result in *real-time*!
* **Drag & Drop Page Builder** - Visually edit the layout of your pages using the drag-&-drop page builder. The options for each element are easily editable, too!
* **Ability to have multiple style options.** - Ideal for theme developers, or a site with a userbase which is allowed to edit the way they view the site. You can choose an entirely different layout for elements such as blog posts.
* **Various choice of thumbnails** - You can choose from a featured image, slider, video (vimeo/youtube), audio (soundcloud), quote or link thumbnail!
* **18 Prebuilt shortcodes** - Make your posts as feature rich as your pages!
